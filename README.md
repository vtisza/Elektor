# Elektor

Neat **Shiny/R** webapp to simulate how the modification of certain election rules would have influenced the result of the Hungarian parliamentary elections in 2014. (Note: Hungarian election law was severely modified in 2013) As a spin-off of the project I am working on an R package implementing different vote-to-mandate allocation algorithms. <br><br>For the deployed version of the app *[Hungarian]* [click here](https://elektor.shinyapps.io/Valasztas/).
